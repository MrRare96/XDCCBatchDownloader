Change nothing starting from the ^ above this sentence,
This section is a bit of explaining, every ^ announces
a new setting option that is not linked to the other
an @ is a new option which is linked to the other.
For example, to use a bot you will have to be on a channel
on which the bot should be to, the Frostii|Tiger can only

be found at the #frostii channel! you csan change the name 
of the option before the = character, but do not add any of
the characters explained above, also do not change 
the order in which these settings appear!
Normally size has to be specified, but for example the
encodes from frostii are only in 720p so they do not need
a specified resolution, if you do specify it, it might not
work!
